# 💜 Fischl

**Fischl** is a fully **serverless Discord bot** designed to handle **interaction-based commands** efficiently. It offers **lightweight deployment** without the need for dedicated hosting.

## ✨ Features

* Currently supports **slash commands/button interactions**.
* More interaction types coming soon! ⚡
* Minimal setup and zero server maintenance.

## ⚡ Why Serverless?

Traditional bots require:

* Dedicated hosting 💻
* Continuous server maintenance 🛠️

Fischl runs on **serverless functions**, meaning:

* Wayy less hosting costs 💸
* No downtime due to server issues 🕒
* Lightweight and efficient deployment

## ⚠️ Limitations

Serverless bots have some natural constraints due to their short-lived runtime. Fischl is **not ideal** for:

* **🎵 Music bots** – Playing music continuously requires persistent runtime, which serverless functions cannot provide (Vercel: ~10s max).
* **🛡️ Moderation bots** – Triggers like offensive messages or spam require continuous monitoring.
* **🎁 Giveaway bots** – Tracking timers and showing results requires always-on uptime.
